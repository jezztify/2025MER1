# Talk 3: The Role of the Christian Husband

## Objectives

- **A.** To explain the role and responsibility of a Christian husband
- **B.** To discuss specific areas in family life where the husband should take active leadership and responsibility

## Expanded Outline

### A. Introduction

1. For us to grow as a Pastoral Team in the family, we must understand more clearly our role as a husband.

2. For many of us, our understanding of responsibility is one-sided (in business, civic affairs, etc.) in which we:
   - **a.** have authority
   - **b.** manage/direct things

3. The other side of responsibility is "to give an account" (Heb. 13). Not only do we men have God's authority to get things done, but we will be held accountable for what we have been given to do.

4. Webster's definition of accountable suggests imminence of retribution for an unfulfilled trust or violated obligation. Example:
   - **a.** Mt. 25:14-30 - Parable of the Silver Pieces
   - **b.** God does not hold us accountable for things beyond our control (situation, people's lives)

### B. Teaching of Scripture on the Husband's Role

1. As a general principle, men are supposed to be responsible for the people of God. They take the leadership. Women are responsible but in a different way.

2. Areas of responsibility are:
   - **a.** Governance of people as a whole: 1 Tim., Heb. 13:17; Ex. 3:16
   - **b.** Leadership in worship: 1 Tim 2:8; 2 Chron. 5
   - **c.** Providing protection: James 5:14; Acts 20:28-31
   - **d.** Head of the family: Eph. 5:22

### C. Husband's Responsibility for Family

1. Men need to understand more the importance of the family and his responsibility to see that it is what God intends.
   - **a.** Men's typical pattern is to leave home and family to wife, while he is responsible only for providing the money
   - **b.** Scripture teaches us the father's proper role (1 Sam. 2:12-ff; Jos. 24:14; Eph. 6:4)

2. Areas where the husband needs to actively lead the family:

#### a. Wife
- Make sure that her basic personal needs are met
- Make sure of adequate communication
- Help her maintain perspective for self and family and Couples for Christ
- Help her in her spiritual growth: spiritual life, prayer, and schedule
- Make sure she has sufficient and good relationships with other persons, particularly with members of Couples for Christ

#### b. Children
- Take leadership and responsibility in teaching them about the Lord; do not leave it to the church, school or community
- Take the leadership in training sons in manly character
- Take the leadership in disciplining the children

#### c. Family life and home
- Set the emotional tone for the home (not the wife)
- Oversee the family schedule (meals, prayer, entertainment and outside activities)
- Teach and lead the family into living the covenant of Couples for Christ and patterns of relationship
- Take charge of social situations - don't leave to wives
- Be the spiritual protector (intercession, spiritual warfare, blessing)

### D. Sources of Support and Strength of the Husband

1. The Lord is our ultimate source of strength: he is the way, the life and the truth. He is the source of wisdom. When we feel weary and find life burdensome, we should turn to the Lord. (Mt. 11:28-30)

2. Turn to the household head for guidance and direction. The Lord anoints his leaders.

3. During your weekly household meeting, open up yourself to brothers that you may receive the needed support and encouragement.
