            <p><strong>Priest:</strong> Dear brothers and sisters, as we gather for this Holy Mass in the spirit of
                God's love and our Marriage Enrichment Retreat, let us call to mind our need for God's mercy and grace
                in our lives and in our marriages. Let us acknowledge our sins, and so prepare ourselves to celebrate
                the sacred mysteries.</p>
            <p><em>(Pause for silent reflection)</em></p>
            <p><strong>All:</strong> I confess to almighty God<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;that I have greatly sinned,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;(And, striking their breast, they say:)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;all the Angels and Saints,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>

                    <p>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her,
                        all you who love her;
                        rejoice with her in joy,
                        all you who mourn over her—
                        that you may nurse and be satisfied
                        from her consoling breast;
                        that you may drink deeply with delight
                        from her glorious bosom.</p>
                    <p>For thus says the Lord:
                        I will extend prosperity to her like a river,
                        and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream;
                        and you shall nurse and be carried on her arm,
                        and dandled on her knees.
                        As a mother comforts her child,
                        so I will comfort you;
                        you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
                        You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice;
                        your bodies shall flourish like the grass;
                        and it shall be known that the hand of the Lord is with his servants,

                        sing the glory of his name;
                        give to him glorious praise.
                        Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
                        Because of your great power, your enemies cringe before you.”</p>
                    <p>All the earth worships you;
                        they sing praises to you,
                        sing praises to your name.”</p>
                    <p>Come and see what God has done:
                        he is awesome in his deeds among mortals.
                        He turned the sea into dry land;
                        they passed through the river on foot.
                        There we rejoiced in him,
                        who rules by his might forever,
                        whose eyes keep watch on the nations—
                        let the rebellious not exalt themselves.</p>
                    <p>Come and hear, all you who fear God,
                        and I will tell what he has done for me.
                        Blessed be God,
                        because he has not rejected my prayer
                        or removed his steadfast love from me.</p>

                    <p>May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has
                        been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is
                        anything; but a new creation is everything! As for those who will follow this rule—peace be upon
                        them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
                    <p>From now on, let no one make trouble for me; for I carry the marks of Jesus branded on my body.

                    style="background: #f6f3e7; border-radius: 8px; padding: 16px; border-left: 4px solid #d39932; color: #474742; font-size: 15px;">
                    <p>After this the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town
                        and place where he himself intended to go. He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the
                        laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
                        Go on your way. See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. Carry no purse,
                        no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to
                        this house!’ And if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that person;
                        but if not, it will return to you. Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they
                        provide, for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. Whenever
                        you enter a town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you; cure the sick who are
                        there, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ But whenever you enter a town
                        and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say, ‘Even the dust of your town that
                        clings to our feet, we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has
                        come near.’ I tell you, on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.”</p>
                    <p>The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!” He said
                        to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you
                        authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing
                        will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice
                        that your names are written in heaven.”</p>

                    I make these promises with all my heart, joining to them my gratitude to God for the blessings with
                    which He promises to sustain our life together, and my gratitude to you, (name of husband/wife), for
                    the affection and the faithfulness which you have vowed to give me as my beloved (husband/wife).
