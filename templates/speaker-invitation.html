            <p>Dear [Speaker's Name],</p>
            <p>With a spirit of faith and service, we humbly invite you to share your gifts as a
                <strong>speaker</strong> at our upcoming <strong>Marriage Enrichment Retreat</strong> — a sacred
                gathering dedicated to strengthening the covenant of marriage in Christ's love.
            </p>
            <p>Your wisdom and experience would be a tremendous blessing to the couples attending. As St. Paul reminds
                us in his letter to the Ephesians, marriage reflects Christ's relationship with His Church, and your
                guidance can help
                these couples grow in understanding this divine mystery.</p>
            <p>We believe your insights on the sacrament of marriage would enrich our community and help couples nurture
                their vocation to holy matrimony. Your presence would be a gift from God to the couples seeking to
                deepen their commitment to each other and to our Lord.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">We pray that the Holy Spirit will guide your discernment in considering this
                invitation.</p>
